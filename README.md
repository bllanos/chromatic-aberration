### Third-party data dependencies
- All demos in [demo_data/README.md](demo_data/README.md) do not require third-party data.

#### CIE 1931 Standard (2-degree) Observer spectral tristimulus functions
- These functions were retrieved from Table 1 of the ASTM E308 standard
  (cited below) and saved as a CSV file.
- In the CSV file, the first column contained wavelength values, and the
  following three columns contained the values of the 'x-bar', 'y-bar',
  and 'z-bar' functions, respectively.
- The data is loaded into the `xyzbar` variable in many scripts.

#### Spectral Power Distribution of a CIE D-Illuminant
- Data used for synthesizing the spectral radiance of a CIE D-illuminant
  for an arbitrary correlated colour temperature was retrieved from Bruce Lindbloom's
  website (cited below).
- The original spreadsheet file published by Bruce Lindbloom was converted
  to a CSV file, where the first column contained wavelength values, and the
  following three columns contained the values of the 'S0', 'S1', and 'S2'
  functions, respectively.
- The data is loaded by several scripts as input for the [aberration_data/ciedIlluminant.m](aberration_data/ciedIlluminant.m)
  function.

#### ColorChecker spectral reflectances
- Spectral reflectance measurements of the patches of the average X-Rite ColorChecker
  chart from Danny Pascale's website (cited below) were used before in-house
  spectral reflectance measurements were available
  (saved as [demo_data/spectral_data/spectra_averaged.csv](demo_data/spectral_data/spectra_averaged.csv)).
- The reflectance data was stored in a CSV file, where the first column contained
  wavelength values, and the following 24 columns contained the spectral reflectances
  of the 24 ColorChecker CLASSIC patches.
- It would be easy to create an equivalent file from
  [demo_data/spectral_data/spectra_averaged.csv](demo_data/spectral_data/spectra_averaged.csv) to use instead in most places.
- Presently, only [aberration_data/BimaterialImages.m](aberration_data/BimaterialImages.m),
  [data_analysis/ColorCheckerClassicPreNov2014.m](data_analysis/ColorCheckerClassicPreNov2014.m), and
  [data_analysis/SpectralDataJune262018.m](data_analysis/SpectralDataJune262018.m) rely on this data.

## Setup
- Add all folders and subfolders to the MATLAB path, excluding [.git/](.git/) and [deprecated/](deprecated/).

## Basic usage instructions
- To run predefined demos, see [demo_data/README.md](demo_data/README.md).
- Files with names starting with capital letters are MATLAB scripts, and can
  be used as described in their documentation comments.
- Remaining files are MATLAB functions called by the scripts.
  There are a few MATLAB functions used for ad-hoc analysis for which no scripts
  have yet been created to call them.
- The tokens `${DIRPATH}` and `${FILEPATH}` that appear in character vector
  literals need to be replaced with directory paths and file paths, respectively,
  that are specific to your data file locations. Some directory and file paths
  are presently set to point to the demo data in [./demo_data/](./demo_data/), but can be
  changed to point to your data.

## Tips
- Raw colour-filter array images as used in this codebase are truly raw. No gamma
  or colour correction has been applied to them. In other demosaicing codebases,
  I have seen the input raw images simulated from full-colour RGB images that
  have already been gamma/colour-corrected, where the simulation process does
  not account for the gamma/colour correction.
- Running more parallel workers will increase memory consumption, but not
  excessively. The code has been designed to avoid having MATLAB send
  redundant data to parallel workers.
- If you want to run the code on your own dataset of images, adjust parameters
  in [SetFixedParameters.m](SetFixedParameters.m). The following parameters are most relevant:
  - `bayer_pattern`
  - `findSamplingOptions`
  - `dispersionfunToMatrixOptions.resolution`

### Troubleshooting

#### Poor performance and out of memory errors
- Image reconstruction
  - Decrease the patch size (`patch_sizes` and `paddings` in [SetFixedParameters.m](SetFixedParameters.m)).
  - Decrease regularization weights, and use fewer regularization terms
    (`weights` in [SetFixedParameters.m](SetFixedParameters.m)).
  - Decrease the number of spectral bands being estimated (`findSamplingOptions.power_threshold` 
    or `findSamplingOptions.n_bands` in [SetFixedParameters.m](SetFixedParameters.m)).
  - Sample spectral dispersion at a coarser resolution (increase
    `dispersionfunToMatrixOptions.resolution` in [SetFixedParameters.m](SetFixedParameters.m)).
  - Skip automatic regularization weight selection: `use_fixed_weights` in
    [SetFixedParameters.m](SetFixedParameters.m).
  - Use a lower limit on possible regularization weights:
    `solvePatchesColorOptions.reg_options.maximum_weights` in [SetFixedParameters.m](SetFixedParameters.m).
  - Lower the number of iterations
    - For image reconstruction: `solvePatchesColorOptions.admm_options.maxit`
      in [SetFixedParameters.m](SetFixedParameters.m).
    - For regularization weight selection: increase `desired_weights_relative_error`
      in [SetFixedParameters.m](SetFixedParameters.m).
- Models of dispersion ([disk_fitting/RAWDiskDispersion.m](disk_fitting/RAWDiskDispersion.m),
  [dispersion_model/RegistrationDispersion.m](dispersion_model/RegistrationDispersion.m),
  and [dispersion_model/DoubleConvexThickLensDispersion.m](dispersion_model/DoubleConvexThickLensDispersion.m)))
  - Use polynomial models instead of spline models (`model_type_choices`)
  - Lower the polynomial degrees tested during cross-validation
    for dispersion modelling (`max_degree_xy_dispersion` and
    `max_degree_lambda`), or vignetting correction (`max_degree_xy_vignetting`
    only in [disk_fitting/RAWDiskDispersion.m](disk_fitting/RAWDiskDispersion.m)).
  - Lower the number of iterations for spline fitting generalized cross-
    validation (`spline_smoothing_options` structure `n_iter` field).
- Raytracing ([dispersion_model/DoubleConvexThickLensDispersion.m](dispersion_model/DoubleConvexThickLensDispersion.m),
  [ray_tracing/DoubleConvexThickLensPSF.m](ray_tracing/DoubleConvexThickLensPSF.m), and [ray_tracing/DoubleConvexThickLensPSF2.m](ray_tracing/DoubleConvexThickLensPSF2.m))
  - Lower the number of rays (`ray_params.n_incident_rays`) or pixels
    (`image_params.image_sampling`) to reduce memory consumption.
  - Ensure `request_spline_smoothing` (an argument of
    [ray_tracing/doubleSphericalLensPSF.m](ray_tracing/doubleSphericalLensPSF.m)) is `false`.
  - To reduce execution time, lower the number of wavelengths
    (`lens_params.wavelengths`), lights (`scene_params.n_lights`),
    and depths (`scene_params.light_distance_factor_larger`
    and `scene_params.light_distance_factor_smaller`).

#### Noisy or inaccurate models of dispersion
- Create masks to guide disk keypoint fitting (files with names ending in '_maskDisks',
  as documented in [disk_fitting/RAWDiskDispersion.m](disk_fitting/RAWDiskDispersion.m)).
- Enable vignetting correction if there is severe vignetting (add files with
  names ending in '_maskVignetting', as documented in [disk_fitting/RAWDiskDispersion.m](disk_fitting/RAWDiskDispersion.m)).
- Use a larger patch size for registration-based dispersion calibration
  (`reg_patch_options` in [dispersion_model/RegistrationDispersion.m](dispersion_model/RegistrationDispersion.m)).

#### Visible seams between patches in output images
- Decrease regularization weights (`weights` in [SetFixedParameters.m](SetFixedParameters.m)),
  if using fixed regularization weights (`use_fixed_weights` in
  [SetFixedParameters.m](SetFixedParameters.m)).
- If using automatic regularization weight selection, avoid using the
  minimum distance criterion to select regularization weights,
  as it tends to set high weights. Set `solvePatchesColorOptions.reg_options.demosaic`
  to `true` in [SetFixedParameters.m](SetFixedParameters.m), and set the first element of `criteria`
  to `false` in [SetFixedParameters.m](SetFixedParameters.m).
- Use a different image patch to select regularization weights:
  `target_patch_weights` in [aberration_correction/CorrectByHyperspectralADMM.m](aberration_correction/CorrectByHyperspectralADMM.m)
  or `params_patches` in [evaluation/describeDataset.m](evaluation/describeDataset.m).
- Use more patches to select regularization weights:
  `params_patches` in [evaluation/describeDataset.m](evaluation/describeDataset.m), or
  `n_patches` in [evaluation/SelectWeightsForDataset.m](evaluation/SelectWeightsForDataset.m)

#### Visible colour-filter array patterns in output images
- Increase regularization weights (`weights` in [SetFixedParameters.m](SetFixedParameters.m)),
  if using fixed regularization weights (`use_fixed_weights` in
  [SetFixedParameters.m](SetFixedParameters.m)).
- If using automatic regularization weight selection based on a demosaicing
  result (`solvePatchesColorOptions.reg_options.demosaic = true`
  in [SetFixedParameters.m](SetFixedParameters.m), or the last element of `criteria`
  is `true` in [SetFixedParameters.m](SetFixedParameters.m)), enforce similarity with all colour
  channels by setting
  `solvePatchesColorOptions.reg_options.demosaic_channels = [true, true, true]`
  in [SetFixedParameters.m](SetFixedParameters.m).
- If using automatic regularization weight selection, try it in the absence
  of a model of dispersion.
- Use a different image patch to select regularization weights:
  `target_patch_weights` in [aberration_correction/CorrectByHyperspectralADMM.m](aberration_correction/CorrectByHyperspectralADMM.m)
  or `params_patches` in [evaluation/describeDataset.m](evaluation/describeDataset.m).
- Use more patches to select regularization weights:
  `params_patches` in [evaluation/describeDataset.m](evaluation/describeDataset.m), or
  `n_patches` in [evaluation/SelectWeightsForDataset.m](evaluation/SelectWeightsForDataset.m)

#### Other undesirable results or suspected bugs
- Try to identify the function which isn't working as expected. Make sure it is
  being called with a "verbose" option, if it accepts one.
- Replace `parfor` with `for` to facilitate finding errors in parallel code by
  temporarily disabling parallel execution. (Note: By design, there are no
  race conditions. The iterations of parallel for-loops are strictly independent.)
- Make sure that the colour-filter array pattern code is correct (the `bayer_pattern`
  parameter in [SetFixedParameters.m](SetFixedParameters.m), and other scripts).

## Detailed description of the codebase
- Use the MATLAB `help` command to view the 'Contents.m' files describing the codebase,
  as explained in MATLAB's documentation, "Create Help Summary Files --- Contents.m".
- A high-level description of the top-level folders is as follows:
  - 'aberration_correction': Chromatic aberration correction, by image warping, or by
    global optimization accounting for image warping and mosaicing.
  - 'aberration_data': Simulation of spectral image to colour image conversion, and
    lateral chromatic aberration (as image warping). Synthetic image generation.
  - 'calibration_data': Tools for creating chromatic aberration calibration patterns
    that can be printed for calibrating real cameras.
  - 'data_analysis': Scripts for producing human-viewable results and analysis
    of the output of other code in the repository. In particular, there are
    scripts for creating colour-corrected images. There are also scripts created
    for tangential or one-time experiments.
  - 'demo_data': Sample data for testing the codebase, and sample results on the
    demo data.
  - 'deprecated': Unmaintained code, that is no longer called by the programs
    in other folders. Code in this folder is present for archival purposes only.
  - 'disk_fitting': Disk keypoint-based calibration of lateral chromatic aberration,
    following the approach of Rudakova and Monasse 2014.
  - 'dispersion_model': All other code for calibrating models of lateral chromatic
    aberration that does not explicitly involve disk keypoints.
  - 'evaluation': Quantitative evaluation of image reconstruction and chromatic
    aberration correction. There are scripts for running many image estimation
    algorithms, including the third-party methods listed above, on dataset
    of images.
  - 'raw_image_preprocessing': Code for creating datasets of images, including
    high-dynamic range images and multispectral images. There are also functions
    for sampling and demosaicing raw colour-filter array images. Note that
    the code in this folder was developed for the particular apparatus that I
    used, and may not be useful for other image capturing setups.
  - 'ray_tracing': Code for simulating and analyzing point spread functions for
    point light sources at different distances and angular positions from a double
    convex lens. This folder is largely present for archival purposes.
    The code it contains was developed for preliminary research investigations,
    and was not used to generate results for any publications.
  - 'sampling': Functions for resampling and numerical integration of signals,
    inspired by sampling theory.
  - 'sensor': Code for saving various camera spectral response functions in the
    format used by the rest of the codebase.
  - 'utilities': Miscellaneous helper functions, such as for data input/output,
    text processing, and geometry calculations.
  - 'vignetting': Calibration and application of models for making image
    intensities more uniform in regions that are subject to lens
    vignetting or to non-uniform lighting.
